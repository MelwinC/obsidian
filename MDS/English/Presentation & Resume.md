Hello, my name is Melwin Chenu.
I'm currently studying for a Master's degree in Full Stack Development.
Ever since I was a child, I've loved working with computers and playing all kinds of games.
So, naturally,  I first trained as a hardware technician, then specialized in development. 
I found it very entertaining because I like solving problems. 
That's also why I went on to do this master's degree.

At the moment, I'm looking for a job as a junior full stack developer. 
I've learned and practiced development using languages like React / Vue / Typescript and Node js based on MongoDB or even PostgreSQL databases. 
Personally, I would say I love learning from people and sharing my skills with them and I'm sure we'll have the opportunity to build on this together.

See you soon, bye
